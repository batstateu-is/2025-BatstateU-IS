# 📁 `model/` Directory – 3D Models Used in Our Robot

This directory contains the **3D models** we used for designing, printing, and simulating parts of our robot. These models were essential in customizing mechanical components and ensuring a functional, efficient design.

| `Camera Case.stl`                        | Custom-designed case to securely mount and protect the camera on the robot. |
| `PRO 2025_Main Robot_New Version.stl`    | Complete 3D model of the main robot chassis used for PRO 2025, including updated design improvements. |

> [!Note]
> The basis of the team's `Camera Case.stl` was based of [this](https://thangs.com/designer/logicalplanet/3d-model/Pocket%20Boxes%20-%20with%20Locking%20Sliding%20Lids-1263156)

### 🛠️ Usage

- All `.stl` files can be imported into 3D modeling or slicing software such as **Fusion 360**, **Blender**, or **Cura**.
- Print with **PLA or PETG** for good strength and durability.
- Ensure proper orientation and supports are set when slicing for 3D printing.

### 📐 Design Philosophy

Our goal with these models was to:
- Reduce weight while maintaining structural integrity
- Improve sensor positioning for more reliable readings
- Make assembly and disassembly straightforward for testing and transport
