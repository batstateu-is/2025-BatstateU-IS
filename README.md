## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineering is the heart of innovation that gives life to initiatives. It bridges science, technology, and creativity to provide solutions for real-world problems. In the field of robotics, engineering allows everyone to think and design beyond the current possibilities, highlighting that a future with numerous solutions can be made. Thus, through this, we were able to challenge ourselves to integrate various engineering concepts in autonomous navigation. As a team of student innovators and future engineers, we embraced this opportunity to create a self-driving robot that exemplifies the spirit of modern engineering. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This engineering documentation provides a comprehensive record of the BatStateU Spartan Team’s design process, program construction,  problem-solving strategies, and technical decisions throughout the development of our self-driving robot. This provides insight into our robot’s architecture, programming approach, and the challenges we encountered and overcame along the way. Intended for the Future Engineers Category in the 24th Philippine Robot Olympiad, this documentation reflects the dedication and initiative of our team to produce an innovation that goes beyond the boundaries of autonomous technology. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have featured key aspects involved in the development of our robot such as the Robot Specifications which provides information about the architecture of the robot, and selection of sensors, motors, and mechanical components with consideration to different aspects like speed, power, and specifications; Mobility Management that focuses on the specific movements that the robot can do; Power and Sense Management that is responsible for the description of the programming language and libraries utilized, algorithm explanations, and program logic flow; Challenge Strategies which features code snippets with explanations of its purpose, and the strategies we came up for the Open Challenge, Obstacle Challenge, traffic sign avoidance, and parking; and performance testings which includes setup conditions, observed issues, and video demonstrations. In addition, the engineering innovations integrated into the robot and a guide for its construction were added. To further support the technical information, the team added visual documentation that features actual and 3D model images of the robot. With these, the team aimed and continuously aims to demonstrate engineering discipline rooted in teamwork, determination, rigorous testing, and excellence with a purpose of being able to think of and design an innovative and modern solution as future engineers.
